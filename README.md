# Concept 
Can't decide what to cook? Overwhelmed with the world wide web of options? Lettuce do the work! Enter: Feed.me - the app that thinks for you (bc let's be honest, you're too hungry to think rn)

The intention is not to reinvent the wheel, but to make something of a game out of the daily task of deciding what to cook. Anyone can serach for rescipes - there's a million blogs & websites for that! This API call sight will do the legwork for the weary eater.
        
# Framework
- initial site view will display an empty kitchen counter, with cooking ingredients scattered about
- at the top will be the concept blurb, an input bar and a search button
- user can click search button with no input, generating an utterly random recipe
- user can also refine their search by entering one (or more???) food items, filtering their result
- user can continue the process until they land on a tasty meal
- recipe will generate in a side by side view - on the right, the image of the final food product; on the left, the ingredients/method
- I want the recipe card to be hidden initially, only showing when a recipe exists
