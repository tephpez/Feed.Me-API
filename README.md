# MVP
- Site view will display an empty kitchen counter with cooking ingredients scattered about to get user in the mood to cook!
- 2 HTML docs - one for home page and second for recipe search page
- User can request a completely random recipe without any direction
- User can also refine their search by entering one food item, filtering their random result
- User can continue the process until they land on a tasty meal
- Recipe will generate in a side by side view - on the right, the image of the final food product; on the left, the ingredients/method - reminiscent of a recipe card
- Search page will be empty until results populate

# POST MVP
